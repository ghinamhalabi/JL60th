<h2>Social Activities</h2>

<p>
We hope participants will enjoy a range of evening activities we've
organized over the week.  The Monday wine tasting and Tuesday beer
tasting both include dinner and are great value at AU$95
each, payable at the meeting.  If you wish to attend either or both
please inform us by Sunday 8th October so we know how many to cater
for.  The reception on the Sunday and the Conference Dinner on the
Thursday are complimentary to registered participants and guests so we
shall assume you will partake of these unless your arrival and
departure dates exclude them.  If for some reason you cannot join us
for these please let us know.
</p>
